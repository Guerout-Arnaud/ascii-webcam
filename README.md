### [C++ ASCII-Webcam](https://github.com/Guerout-Arnaud/ascii-webcam)


## INFO
Based on a [ASCII-Webcam](https://github.com/micodeyt/ascii-webcam)

Initially made in Python, this projet is a fork from Micode project.
I wanted to push it futher and, as Micode and Hardisk mentioned in [this video](https://youtu.be/DBnStqiLB-Q) make a virtual camera out of it.
Unfortunately, I don't like Python so I made it in C++

Project is currently WIP but it will come soon
